### Hello! 

* I am currently learning how to be a web developer through the online course provided by [Mittuniversitetet](https://www.miun.se/ "Mittuniversitetet")
* Right now, we're working on web accessibility, as well as development with C# (.NET) -- my third language. Cool!
* This is my GitHub page for publishing university projects -- and later some projects of my own as well! Right now I am working on an IG clone. 
* In my spare time, I like to narrate audiobooks and write fantasy stories.
* One day, I'll make a choose-your-own fantasy adventure you can play in your browser.
